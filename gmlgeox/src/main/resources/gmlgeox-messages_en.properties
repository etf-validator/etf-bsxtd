gmlgeox.validation.parsing.xml = Error parsing element {0} with id {1} : {2}
gmlgeox.validation.parsing.unexpected = Unexpected Error parsing element : {0}

gmlgeox.validation.geometry.gml.unknown-version=No known GML version found (found namespace: {0}).

gmlgeox.validation.geometry.curvediscontinuity=Invalid curve. Curve not continuous. Starting point {0} of segment no. {1} is not the same as end point {2} of the previous element.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.unsupported=The geometry contains an unsupported element. Details: {0}
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.exteriorRingCW=Invalid polygon. Outer ring is oriented clockwise.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.interiorRingCCW=Invalid polygon. Inner ring no. {0} is oriented counterclockwise.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.ringnotclosed=Invalid polygon. Ring is not closed. Starting point {0} is not the same as end point {1}.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.not.simple.intersection=The geometry is not simple due to self-intersection.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.not.simple=The geometry is not simple.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.surfacepatchesnotconnected=Invalid surface. The patches of the surface are not connected.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.repetitionincurvesegment=Invalid geometry. Repetition of coordinate in curve segment no. {0}.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.non.linear.segment=Cannot determine control points for curve, contains non-linear segments.

gmlgeox.validation.geometry.jts.2 = Invalid polygon. A hole lies partially or completely in the exterior of the shell.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.jts.3 = Invalid polygon. A hole lies in the interior of another hole in the same polygon.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.jts.4 = Invalid polygon. The interior of a polygon is disjoint (this may be caused by set of contiguous holes splitting the polygon into two parts).
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.jts.5 = Invalid polygon. Two rings of the polygonal geometry intersect.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.jts.6 = Invalid polygon. A ring self-intersects.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.jts.7 = Invalid polygon. The polygon component of the MultiPolygon lies inside another polygonal component.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.jts.8 = Invalid polygon. The polygonal geometry contains two rings which are identical.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.jts.9 = The LineString contains either a single point or a LinearRing contains 2 or 3 points.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.jts.10 = Invalid coordinate. The X or Y ordinate of a Coordinate is not a valid numeric value.
gmlgeox.validation.geometry.jts.11 = Invalid ring. The ring is not correctly closed (the first and the last coordinate are different).
